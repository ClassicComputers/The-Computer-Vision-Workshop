# Chapter 10: Possive 3D Reconstruction

3D reconstruction is the process of capturing the shape and appearance of real objects in three dimensions. This process can be accomplished either by active or passive methods. Passive 3D reconstruction methods calculate 3D data without any extra active light source but only natural or environmental lights. In this Chapter, main methods for passive 3D reconstruction are reviewed.
