# Chapter 12: 3D Visualization

To represent objects in 3D, there are typically 3 steps. The 1st step is the 3D point cloud. In this step, you can roughly tell how the object looks like. Step 2 represents the object’s shape with polygons, which looks like a mesh. The 3rd step renders the object’s texture on the surface of the shape. Both shape and texture consist of the object’s appearance.
