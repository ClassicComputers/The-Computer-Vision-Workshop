# Section 09.1: Pinhole Camera Calibration

Cannonical theories and methods of pinhole camera calibration have been deeply investigated for about two centuries. OpenCV tutorial [Camera calibration With OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/d4/d94/tutorial_camera_calibration.html) has dedicately summarized various calibration methods for a single pinhole camera, including:
- Classical black-white chessboard
- Symmetrical circle pattern
- Asymmetrical circle pattern

Clearly, these three methods only varies in respect of calibration boards.
