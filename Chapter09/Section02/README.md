# Section 09.2: Fisheye Camera Calibration

As a particular type of pinhole camera, the fisheye camera has been widely applied in VR/AR recently. Spherical images taken by fisheye cameras are extremely distorted. A more sophisticated method to remove heavy distortion has to be applied for fisheye cameras. OpenCV tutorial [Fishey camera model](https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/db/d58/group__calib3d__fisheye.html) provides such tools.
